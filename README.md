**Usage**

*To train and test the program*
```
python main.py
```

*Description of each python file*

- `data_split.py`: Randomly split meters into groups evenly.The original data should be the real reading of each users while each meter are stored into one column with its id as header. Each row represent a time stamp. The grouped data will be stored into `data/groupedData`.
- `tampered_data`: This program manipulated the reading data following specific functions. It also generate the real total power consumption of each group and stored into `data/observed` Check the paper to get the details of each FDI attack function. Placed grouped user reading profile into `data/groupedData` directory. Generated observed metering data will be placed into `data/observed` directory. The tampered data and fradulent user id will be stored into each "FDI#" subdirecroty.
- `main.py`: Main process of the program. Read the data generated by `tampered_data.py`.
- `func.py`: Help functions.
